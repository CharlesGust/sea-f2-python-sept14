A Short Story About James
=======

##The Decision

A few years ago, my wife and I were living in Northern California. We loved it, but we wanted a change. We looked at a map and thought about a few different states. We liked Arizona, but we didn't want the sweaty summers. We liked Portland, but it was almost just an extension of California. Nevada just wasn't our type. We had no choice but to move to Seattle. We instantly fell in love. The first time we visited was a few weeks before we moved. We both had job interviews. We loved everything about the Pacific Northwest. We headed home, packed our things and hopped in a moving truck a couple weeks later.

##Seattle

We're now going on three years in Seattle. I've been managing a restaurant and bar in a hotel in downtown. I enjoy my line of work, but it's not always conducive to quality time with family. My wife, Karli, and I have been blessed with a lovely baby girl, Hazel. She's now nine months old and growing faster than ever.

##Why Programming?

I can remember a time when I was very little being told by family friends that I would grow up to be a cop. I didn't really know what they meant by this at the time, but later found out that they meant I asked too many questions. I was always asking my dad "how does this work?" and "why does that happen?". I always wanted to know the system and what caused it to work. I was fascinated by everything from pipes and plumbing, to weather and cars.

When I was in high school, my desire to discover was redirected when I took a class on computer programming that was offered as a last minute elective. I quickly signed up for the class. We studied Visual Basic. I had a blast. I enjoyed writing simple programs that I could use every day.

After high school, I went off to college torn between majoring in Art and majoring in Physics. Initially I was going to tackle a double major, but that was quickly derailed when I skipped a few too many of my Calculus classes. In my naive youth I decided to drop the science major and stick with art. After all, I didn't want to be an engineer, so *why* would I need science? Taking pictures and working on photography sounded so much more fun.

The irony was that as I began to immerse myself in the photographic arts I became nearly fanatical about the science of it all. I even began building my own cameras, making my own film and mixing my own chemicals that I was sourcing from all over the country. Also during this time, I began to write websites for myself and fellow students. I picked up some HTML books and went crazy. It seemed so powerful and exhilarating to be able to write an entire web page that could be seen by anyone *anywhere* in the world!

After college I stayed at my current job in a local restaurant. Eventually I was promoted to the restaurant manager. I definitely built an appreciation for the art of cuisine, wine and the relationships that are created around meals. I fell in love with the importance of the details. In a sense, I was helping to build the guest experience with the details that we put into the evening. We were creating an experience for someone. It wasn't just an art, it was a science.

I've come to not only enjoy, but thrive within the dichotomy of art and science. To me, it's an area of function and beauty combined and it seems under-appreciated and often overlooked.
