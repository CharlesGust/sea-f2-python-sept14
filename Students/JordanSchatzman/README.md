# Jordan Schatzman
## September 9, 2014
My name is Jordan Schatzman and I am a recent graduate from the University of Washington. I graduated in August of 2013 with a degree in
applied physics and a minor in applied mathematics. My interests lie in technology, video games, and physical fitness along with the usaul going
out with my friends on the weekends.

I am taking this class in hopes of helping me land a job that will put me on a path to success. I understand Python is the language of
choice for many developers in the data space, so learning it should be a great help to me. In general, so far I have enjoyed the class and I
find the course material interesting. I have little doubt this will continue.
