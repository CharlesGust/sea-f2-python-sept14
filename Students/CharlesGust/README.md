I'm really looking forward to getting to know all of you and learning with you!

Although you could explore the links, in a nutshell, I'm a former professional software developer looking to acquaint myself with developments over the last 15-20 years. I have a lot of C programming experience, and some C++ and Java programming experience.

My goal is to be working in this field before the end of the year.
