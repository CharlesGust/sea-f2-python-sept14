lambda and keyword argument magic

Write a function that returns a list of n functions, such that each one,
 when called, will return the input value, incremented by an increasing number.

Use a for loop, lambda, and a keyword argument

Not clear? hereâ€™s what you should get

    In [96]: the_list = function_builder(4)
### so the_list should contain n functions (callables)

    In [97]: the_list[0](2)
    Out[97]: 2
## the zeroth element of the list is a function that add 0
## to the input, hence called with 2, returns 2

    In [98]: the_list[1](2)
    Out[98]: 3
    ## the 1st element of the list is a function that adds 1
    ## to the input value, thus called with 2, returns 3

    In [100]: for f in the_list:
        print f(5)
       .....:
    5
    6
    7
    8
### If you loop through them all, and call them, each one adds one more to the
 input, 5... i.e. the nth function in the list adds n to the input.

Extra credit:

Do it with a list comprehension, instead of a for loop
